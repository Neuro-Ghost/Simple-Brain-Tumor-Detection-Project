# Brain Tumor Detection with SVM

This project utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of brain tumor images into 'no_tumor' and 'pituitary_tumor' categories. 

## Installation

Ensure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage

Run the script model.py after installing the required packages and organizing the dataset. The script will train the SVM model, evaluate its performance, and visualize predictions.

For an optimal experience, it's recommended to use PyCharm IDE for running the project.
